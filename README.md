## Usage

## Plugin Settings

You can customize the behavior and appearance of the chatbot through the plugin settings in the WordPress admin area. These settings include:

- API Settings: Enter your OpenAI API key to enable chat functionality.
- Custom JSON Data: Add Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) directly through the admin panel.
- Chat Title and Welcome Message: Customize the chatbot's title and welcome message for visitors.


#### Allowing Visitors to Search the site for Information

The OpenAI Chat WordPress Plugin includes a search feature that allows users to find specific information on your website. To use it, instruct users to follow these steps:

1. Start a conversation with the chatbot by typing a message.
2. Type "search" followed by the keyword or topic they want to search for. For example:
   - To find a page named "Contact Us," they can type: `search Contact Us`
   - To search for information about turtles, they can type: `search turtles`
3. The chatbot will attempt to find a page on your website that matches the user's query. If it finds a match, it will provide the URL link to that page.
4. If no matching page is found, the chatbot will attempt to provide an answer based on the available FAQs or refer the user to ChatGPT for assistance.

This search feature helps users quickly locate relevant information on your website using natural language queries.

### Shortcode

To add the chatbot to your pages or posts, use the `[openai_chat]` shortcode. You can customize the chatbot's title and welcome message by providing attributes to the shortcode.

Example shortcode: `[openai_chat title="Chat with Us"]`

### FAQ Integration

You can add and manage FAQs directly through the admin panel or by importing custom JSON data. FAQs are used to provide answers to common questions your visitors may have.

Please be aware that I do not offer free support for my free plugins. If you require any modifications, customizations, or changes to the plugin's functionality, these are what I consider paid jobs, and I do not provide them for free.
