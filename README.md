This is a free plugin. There is no paid version or pro version of this plugin!! Also it does cost to use OpenAI (ChatGPT)'s API! I am not charging you! OpenAI is. (There was some confusion before so I want to say this before anyone claims I'm charging them money for this plugin.)

The plugin author and developer are not liable for any damages, losses, or issues that may arise from its use.

### Important: OpenAI API Charges

This plugin relies on OpenAI's API, which may incur real charges when used. You must obtain an API key from OpenAI and agree to OpenAI's terms and pricing before using this plugin. OpenAI's pricing and terms are subject to change, and it's your responsibility to understand and comply with them.

## Installation

1. Upload the `openai-chat` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure the plugin settings in the WordPress dashboard under 'OpenAI Chat Settings.'

## Plugin Settings

You can customize the behavior and appearance of the chatbot through the plugin settings in the WordPress admin area. These settings include:

- API Settings: Enter your OpenAI API key to enable chat functionality.
- Custom JSON Data: Add Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) directly through the admin panel.
- Chat Title and Welcome Message: Customize the chatbot's title and welcome message for visitors.

## Usage

### Shortcode

To add the chatbot to your pages or posts, use the `[openai_chat]` shortcode. You can customize the chatbot's title and welcome message by providing attributes to the shortcode.

Example shortcode: `[openai_chat title="Chat with Us"]`

### FAQ Integration

You can add and manage FAQs directly through the admin panel or by importing custom JSON data. FAQs are used to provide answers to common questions your visitors may have.

### Important Note Regarding Support

Please be aware that I do not offer free support for my free plugins. If you require any modifications, customizations, or changes to the plugin's functionality, these are what I consider paid jobs, and I do not provide them for free. (Sadly, I've been burned by the internet before so now I require the fee as 1/2 upfront and the rest upon delivery. NO Exceptions!)

Thank you for your understanding and for using the OpenAI Chat WordPress Plugin.
